Mansion of Murders

Spinechilling bloodbath textgame set somewhere in Victorian England.

To play, download Distributable folder and run game.py in python. Tested only in python 3.4.

Returnable is same but it uses mariaDB for database, where distributable uses pythons built in sqlite3, so there is more hassle to it. This was a school project about databases, so that is why it exists.
